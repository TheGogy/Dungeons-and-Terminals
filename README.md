# Dungeons and Terminals

Dungeons & Dragons inside a TUI, made with ncurses and Gemini LLM. You can perform any action in this infinite world, and the AI won't forget anything - keeping track of all your stats and inventory.

Dungeons and Terminals exists in two versions: **Linux**, and **Windows**.

The **Linux** version is newer and supports symbolic fonts, initial prompt selection, death screens, and an easter egg.

The **Windows** version contains an experimental prompting system and an adaptive AI sprite system with mouse-drawn sprites on MS Paint.
